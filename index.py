"""
This script finds the missing Purchase orders (PO#s) in a set of excel files that are invoices
It compares the PO#s in the excel files against a list of Purchase Order numbers from a directory
If any PO#s are missing from the Excel files, it prints a list of the missing PO#s

Technologies used:
- pandas: for processing the excel files

Inputs:
- A folder in the Desktop directory that contains a series of PO numbers called PO#s
- A folder in the Desktop directory that contains a series of excel files which are invoices

Outputs:
- Prints a message for the excel files that have missing purchase orders that need to be added to the PO#s list
- Ouputs a set of all the missing Purchase order numbers that need to be retrieved from the database
